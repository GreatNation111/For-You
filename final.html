        <h1>After Everything</h1>
        <p>“I know we ended, but I had to send this cause I put so much effort into it. I’ve been writing a lot since, figuring things out. It’s all here if you ever wonder.”</p>

            <h2>My Final Message</h2>
            <div class="letter-content">

                <p>I’ve been thinking about us a lot—those late nights laughing, the way you’d look at me when things were quiet. I didn’t finish this before because life got in the way, and then we broke up, and it hurt like hell. Writing this now, I just wanted to put it somewhere, even if you never see it. I hope you’re okay? I don’t think I’ll ever love someone the way I loved you, and that’s okay.This site was meant to be yours—a gift I started when I thought we’d be forever. I never finished it, just like us. But I’m here now, tying up loose ends, not because I expect anything, but because some things need to be said—for me, and maybe for you, if you ever stumble across this.

                    I miss you. I miss us—the way we laughed, the way I felt like I could be more just because you saw me. I dream of days when it was you and me, building something real, not just a website. Those moments still live in me, and I wonder if they ever cross your mind. You walked away, though. You chose to close that chapter, and I’m left here, sifting through what remains. If you ever feel that pull, that flicker of what we had, know there’s no shame in remembering. No pride too big to set aside. I’d never look at you as less for it—never could.
                    
                    You were the only one I let in, deeper than anyone. My worst secret—that fight with lust, the habit I’m ashamed of, the one I’d hide from the world? I showed it to you. Not favour, not my closest friends(except daniel)—only you. I gave you my logins, my trust, my rawest self, because I thought you’d hold it carefully. I was wrong, but I don’t regret it. Loving you that much taught me who I am. I’m not proud of where I’m at—drinking when I never did before you, chasing distractions to dull the ache—but I’m honest about it. I wish I could’ve been enough for you to stay, but I’ve learned it wasn’t just about me.
                    
                    I’ve spent months since you left, digging into why—reading about people, patterns, the ways we love and lose. Again, You always said you read psychology books too, so I wonder if you ever glimpsed what makes you run. You left with excuses, no closure, and I’m still chasing answers. I think you’re scared—not of me, but of what staying asks of you. I don’t hold it against you. I just want you to find peace, even if it’s not with me. I still care—maybe foolishly, but it’s true.
                    
                    This site’s my way of finishing what I started, a piece of us I couldn’t leave undone. It’s not a plea or a promise—just a space where I keep what was true. If you’re reading this, know I’ve never wished you anything but good. You know where to find me, if you ever want to. I’m finding my way, carrying a piece of us forward. I hope you find yours.</p>
