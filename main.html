            <div class="letter-content">

                <p>Happy, happy birthday, my love!❤Today is all about celebrating you—the most incredible, beautiful, and kind-hearted person I know. Even though distance separate us, my heart feels so close to you, wrapped up in every memory we’ve made and every dream we’re building together💕. I wish I could be there to hold you, to see your smile light up the room, but I hope these words can wrap you in all the love I’m sending from afar.🥺

                    You are my everything, Harir❤. Every day with you, even across the distance, feels like a gift. Your laughter, your gentle way of understanding me, the way you make every moment brighter just by being you…it’s all so precious to me. I think about our late-night calls, the way we share our hopes and fears, and how you make me feel like I’m home (“babe….it’s okay”) , no matter where I am. You’re not just my girlfriend; you’re my best friend(permit me just today😹), my safe place, my reason to smile when the days get tough🤭.
                    
                    On your birthday, I want you to know how much you mean to me. You’re the kind of person who makes the world better just by existing. Your heart is so big, your spirit so radiant, and I’m endlessly grateful that I get to love you. I wish I could give you the sun, the stars, and every beautiful thing in this universe because that’s what you deserve….not just today, but every single day.
                    
                    I’m counting down the days until we’re together again, until I can hold your hand and celebrate you in person (i pray it comes fr). 🙏Until then, I hope you feel me with you today (cause i am actually with you baby), cheering you on, loving you with every beat of my heart. I’ve been thinking about all the little things I adore about you, like the way you get so excited about your favorite food😹, or how you always know just what to say to make me laugh. Those moments are my treasures, and they make this distance feel like nothing compared to the love we share.
                    
                    I hope today is as special as you are.🫠 I hope it’s filled with all the things that make you happiest your favorite food, the people who adore you, and moments that make your heart sing. And I hope you know that I’m here, always, loving you more than words can ever capture.❤
                    
                    Happy birthday, my sweet, incredible girl. Here’s to you, to us, and to all the beautiful birthdays we’ll share in the years to come. I love you more than you’ll ever know, today and forever, forever baby…no matter what happens🤞🏻❤.</p>

            <div class="letter-content">
                <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my angel! 🌹Today, my heart is overflowing with thoughts of you, and even though we’re miles apart, I feel you so close—like you’re right here, filling my world with warmth and joy. I wish I could be there to hold you tight, to look into your beautiful and cute eyes, and to tell you in person just how much you mean to me. But until that moment comes, I’m pouring all my love into these words…. You are my everything, HARIR. 🌹Every single day, you make my life brighter, softer, and so much more beautiful. I think about the way you laugh, the way your voice feels like home during our late-night calls, and how you have this incredible ability to make even the simplest moments feel like magic. You’re not just my girlfriend—you’re my best friend, my confidante, my safe haven, and the person who makes my heart skip a beat every time I think of you. And I think of you all the time.

                    On this Valentine’s Day, I want you to know that you are loved beyond measure. You’re the kind of person who lights up the world with your kindness, your strength, and that gorgeous spark in your soul. I’m so grateful for every moment we’ve shared—the silly conversations, the quiet moments where we just get each other (we just be in sync), the dreams we whisper about our future.🫠 Those moments are my treasures, and they remind me that no distance could ever dim what we have. You’re my forever, and I feel so lucky to be yours.🥺🥹
                    
                    I wish I could be there to surprise you with flowers, to steal a kiss, or to just sit with you and soak in the happiness of being near you. But for now, I’m sending you all my love, wrapped up with a promise: every day we’re apart only makes me more excited for the day we close that gap for good. I’m counting down to the moment I can hold your hand (i believe in us✋🙂‍↕), feel your warmth, and make new memories together.
                    
                    Happy Valentine’s Day, My breathtaking love. You are my heart’s home, and I love you more than words can ever say. Cheers to us, to our love, and to all the Valentine’s Days we’ll share, side by side, in the years to come.
                    
                    Forever Yours babyyy❤💕</p>
